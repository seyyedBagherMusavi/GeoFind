- **search in shape**: Utilize the power of MongoDB's geospatial indexing and Spring Data's magic method `findByLocationWithin` to search for  places in shape.
- **Spatial Data Storage**: Store and manage spatial data efficiently using MongoDB's geospatial features within a Spring Boot application.
- **Mongock Database Migration**: Seamlessly handle database migrations and data versioning using Mongock, ensuring smooth updates and maintenance of the GIS project.
- **Easy Integration**: The project is designed to be easily integrated into any Spring Boot application, providing a solid foundation for GIS functionality.
